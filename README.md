# CiviCRM ApiLimitSettings

## What is ApiLimitSettings?
By default, CiviCRM adds a limit of 25 to the number of results returned by any API call, if not other is specified.

This default behaviour has caused some errors, since the calls without limit specified are in most of the cases expecting to receive all the existing records.

ApiLimitSettings modifies that default limit, making it equals to 0, meaning that all the results will be returned.


## How do I get ApiLimitSettings?
